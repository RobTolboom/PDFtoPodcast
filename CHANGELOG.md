## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Pipeline Execution Metadata** - Comprehensive metadata embedded in step JSON files
  - Added `_pipeline_metadata` field to all step outputs (classification, extraction, validation, correction)
  - Metadata includes: timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC), duration_seconds, LLM provider/model, max_pages, PDF filename, execution_mode (streamlit/cli), status (success/failed)
  - Error handling: Failed steps save `{step}-failed.json` with metadata including error_message and error_type
  - Automatic metadata stripping before schema validation and LLM prompts via `_strip_metadata_for_pipeline()`
  - Enables cost analytics, debugging, and audit trail without external database
  - Added 7 unit tests for metadata stripping helper function (118 total unit tests)
  - Non-breaking: metadata is optional and doesn't affect existing code or schemas
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` covering all 4 pipeline steps

- **Enhanced Verbose Logging Metadata** - Comprehensive API response metadata for debugging and cost optimization
  - Response IDs for debugging and support tickets (both OpenAI and Claude)
  - Model tracking: exact model version used (e.g., "gpt-5-2025-04-14", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
  - Cached tokens display with cache hit percentage for cost optimization (OpenAI only)
  - Reasoning tokens and summary for GPT-5/o-series models with effort level
  - Response status and stop_reason tracking
  - Metadata stored in `_metadata` field in result dict (non-breaking addition)
  - Streamlit verbose display enhanced with:
    - Cache efficiency section showing cached token percentage
    - Reasoning tokens prominently displayed when significant
    - Response metadata section with model, response_id, status
    - Expandable reasoning summary for GPT-5/o-series (üß† icon)
  - Updated OpenAI provider: 2 locations in `_parse_response_output()` (success + repair paths)
  - Updated Claude provider: 2 locations (`generate_json_with_schema()`, `generate_json_with_pdf()`)
  - Updated Streamlit: `_display_verbose_info()` in `src/streamlit_app/screens/execution.py`

### Fixed
- Fixed schema bundler creating self-referencing definitions causing validation recursion errors
  - `schemas/json-bundler.py` - Replace local alias definitions with actual definitions from common schema
  - Prevents `ContrastEffect` and similar aliases from becoming `{"$ref": "#/$defs/ContrastEffect"}` self-references
  - Resolves "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error during validation step
  - Affects `observational_analytic_bundled.json` and `interventional_trial_bundled.json`

- **Execution Screen Real-time Feedback** - Fixed step status visibility and updates during pipeline execution
  - Fixed step containers not showing during execution (only "‚è≥ Pipeline is executing..." was visible)
  - Fixed non-selected steps showing "pending" instead of "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped"
  - Fixed first step showing "pending" instead of "üîÑ Running" when pipeline starts
  - Fixed all steps now show "üîÑ Running" status immediately before execution begins (added `st.rerun()` after status update)
  - Removed static "0.0s" elapsed time from running status (shown only for completed/failed)
  - Implemented proactive status updates to work within Streamlit's execution model constraints
  - Added `_mark_next_step_running()` helper to auto-update next step after completion
  - Improved user experience with immediate, accurate step status feedback

- **Partial Pipeline Runs** - Fixed "dependency not found" error when running individual steps
  - Added `PipelineFileManager.load_json()` to load cached results from `tmp/` folder
  - Enables running validation after classification+extraction (separate runs)
  - Enables re-running correction without re-doing extraction
  - Smart fallback: checks previous_results first, then loads from disk, then errors
  - Console feedback (yellow üìÇ) when loading from disk
  - Better error messages indicating missing dependency files
  - Added 4 new unit tests (111 total tests passing)

### Changed
- **Pipeline Execution Architecture** - Switched to step-by-step execution with real-time UI updates
  - Execute one step at a time with `st.rerun()` between steps instead of running all steps at once
  - Added `current_step_index` to execution state for progress tracking (0-3)
  - Users see immediate UI updates as each step completes (Classification ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Correction)
  - Fixes bug where multi-step selection showed static status during execution
  - Maintains all error handling, callbacks, and status tracking functionality
  - Special handling for correction step which returns dict with two keys

### Added

### Deprecated
- Nothing yet

### Removed
- **test.py** - Removed temporary exploratory test file from project root
- **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Removed redundant setup announcement file
  - Content already covered in DEVELOPMENT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md
  - Was a one-time setup summary, not ongoing documentation
  - No references from other documentation files

### Fixed
- **schemas/json-bundler.py** - Fixed critical bug in schema bundling that caused unresolved $refs
  - Problem: Bundler only copied first-level definitions from common.schema.json, but didn't recursively resolve nested $refs within those definitions
  - Example: When bundling `Metadata` definition, it didn't also copy `Author`, `Registration`, `SupplementFile`, etc. that Metadata references
  - Impact: All 5 bundled schemas had 5-7 unresolved $refs each, causing validation failures
  - Solution: Implemented recursive definition collection using a worklist algorithm
    - Added `include_local` parameter to `find_common_refs()` to detect local #/$defs/Name references
    - Modified `bundle_schema()` to recursively process nested dependencies until all are resolved
    - Each embedded definition is now scanned for additional references, which are added to the processing queue
  - Result: All 5 schemas now pass validation with 0 unresolved $refs
  - Files affected: All *_bundled.json schemas now correctly include all transitive dependencies
  - **Tests added**: Comprehensive test coverage following @CONTRIBUTING.md requirements
    - 12 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_json_bundler.py`
    - 5 integration tests in `tests/integration/test_schema_bundling.py`
    - Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/schemas/` with nested reference examples
    - Regression test ensures nested refs (Metadata‚ÜíAuthor, Registration‚ÜíRegistry) are all resolved
    - All 17 tests pass ‚úÖ
