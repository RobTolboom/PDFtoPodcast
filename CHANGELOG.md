## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 1)** - Core loop logic with automatic quality improvement
  - Added `run_validation_with_correction()` main loop function (~260 lines)
  - Automatic iterative correction until quality thresholds met or max iterations reached
  - Quality assessment: `is_quality_sufficient()` checks completeness (≥90%), accuracy (≥95%), schema compliance (≥95%), critical issues (0)
  - Best iteration selection: `_select_best_iteration()` using weighted quality score (40% completeness + 40% accuracy + 20% schema)
  - Early stopping: `_detect_quality_degradation()` stops loop when quality degrades for 2 consecutive iterations
  - Metrics extraction: `_extract_metrics()` computes overall quality scores for comparison
  - Error handling: Integrated retry logic with exponential backoff for LLM failures, graceful degradation for schema/JSON errors
  - Constants: `STEP_VALIDATION_CORRECTION`, `DEFAULT_QUALITY_THRESHOLDS`, `FINAL_STATUS_CODES` (7 status codes)
  - File naming: Iterations saved as `extraction0.json`, `extraction1.json`, `validation0.json`, `validation1.json`, etc.
  - Comprehensive test suite: 25 tests across 5 test classes with full edge case coverage
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` (5 helper functions + main loop)
  - Tests in `tests/unit/test_iterative_validation_correction.py` (143 total unit tests, all passing)
  - Non-breaking: Existing validation/correction steps remain unchanged for backward compatibility

- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 2)** - File management and persistence
  - Added logging after file saves for traceability (`console.print` statements)
  - Fixed file naming pattern: `extraction-corrected{N}.json` (using `-` not `_` between step and status)
  - Verified file persistence across all iterations (iteration 0 has no suffix, iterations 1+ have `-corrected{N}`)
  - Test suite: 3 tests in `tests/unit/test_file_management_iterations.py` verifying correct file naming
  - All iteration data kept in memory during loop execution (no lazy loading)
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` (2 logging statements added)
  - Tests verify: iteration 0 naming, corrected suffix pattern, full multi-iteration save sequence

- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 3)** - Backward compatibility and pipeline integration
  - Added `STEP_VALIDATION_CORRECTION` constant to pipeline step constants
  - Updated `ALL_PIPELINE_STEPS` to use new combined step (replaces separate validation+correction in default pipeline)
  - Legacy steps (`STEP_VALIDATION`, `STEP_CORRECTION`) remain available for CLI backward compatibility
  - Added elif-branch in `run_single_step()` to dispatch to `run_validation_with_correction()`
  - Updated docstring with comprehensive step documentation including legacy step notes

  - All 152 unit tests pass (including 6 new backward compat tests)
  - Fixed 2 execution screen tests to expect 3 pipeline steps instead of 4
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` (constant, list update, elif-branch, validation logic)
  - Non-breaking: Old validation/correction steps still work, new combined step integrates seamlessly

- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 4)** - Streamlit UI integration with real-time updates
  - Added pandas dependency (>=2.0.0) for iteration history tables
  - Updated session state defaults: `max_correction_iterations=3`, quality thresholds (completeness=0.90, accuracy=0.95, schema=0.95)
  - Settings screen: New "Validation & Correction" section with max iterations input and 3 threshold sliders (capped at 0.99 to prevent infinite loops)
  - Execution screen: New `_display_validation_correction_result()` function (~75 lines) displays final status, iteration count, best iteration selection, history table (pandas DataFrame), and metrics
  - Updated pipeline step display from 4 to 3 steps: Classification, Extraction, Validation & Correction
  - Updated breakpoint options to include `validation_correction` step
  - All step definitions updated to use new 3-step model throughout Streamlit app
  - Implementation: `requirements.txt`, `session_state.py`, `settings.py` (step defs + UI section), `execution.py` (imports, display function, elif case, 3 display calls)
  - Feature 100% complete: Backend (Phases 1-3) + UI (Phase 4) fully integrated
  - All 152 unit tests passing, backward compatible with CLI

- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 3.5)** - CLI support for single-step execution
  - Added `--step` CLI argument with 5 choices: classification, extraction, validation, correction, validation_correction

  - Added step-specific result display for CLI output (classification, validation_correction, validation)
  - Updated CLI help text with usage examples
  - Exported `run_single_step` from `src.pipeline` module (was missing from public API)
  - Implementation: `run_pipeline.py` (~148 lines added/modified), `src/pipeline/__init__.py` (1 export added)
  - Backward compatible: Full pipeline runs when no `--step` specified
  - Examples: `python run_pipeline.py paper.pdf --step validation_correction --max-iterations 2 --completeness-threshold 0.85`

- **Iterative Validation-Correction Loop (Fase 5)** - Comprehensive error handling tests
  - Added `TestErrorHandling` class with 5 new unit tests (193 lines)
  - Test coverage: LLM failures, retry mechanism, schema failures, unexpected errors, JSON decode errors
  - Verified error handling: LLM API failures retried 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Verified graceful degradation: All error types preserve iterations and return meaningful status codes
  - Test results: All 30 tests in `test_iterative_validation_correction.py` pass (25 existing + 5 new)
  - Error scenarios covered: failed_llm_error, failed_schema_validation, failed_invalid_json, failed_unexpected_error
  - Implementation: `tests/unit/test_iterative_validation_correction.py` (added TestErrorHandling class)
  - Validation: Error handling already implemented in Phase 1, tests confirm correct behavior

### Changed
- **Interventional Extraction Prompt & Schema Alignment** - Strengthened validation instructions and aligned prompt with schema requirements
  - Enhanced CLOSED WORLD ASSUMPTION: Explicit messaging that "additionalProperties":false applies at ALL nesting levels
  - Added ALL-OR-NOTHING RULE: Omit entire parent object rather than emitting partial data when confidence is low
  - Type correctness enforcement: Booleans must be JSON booleans (true/false), never strings ("true"/"false")
  - Numeric correctness: All numbers must be JSON numbers, never strings (no "1.5" or "95%")
  - Primary outcome fallback logic: When no primary outcome is explicitly stated, mark first outcome as is_primary:true to satisfy schema's `contains` constraint
  - P-value handling guidance: Exact numbers as JSON numbers (0.042), thresholds as strings ("<0.001"), no conversion
  - Enhanced PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST: 13 checks (was 10) including type validation, metadata exclusion, and nested key validation
  - Explicit disallowed keys: correction_notes, _metadata, _pipeline_metadata, vendor metadata
  - Resolves conflict: Schema already required at least one primary outcome via `contains` constraint, prompt now handles fallback case
  - Implementation: prompts/Extraction-prompt-interventional.txt (~220 lines)
  - Impact: Better LLM adherence to schema, fewer validation failures, clearer error messages

- **File Naming Schema** - Changed iteration file naming to use consistent numbering across all iterations
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Old iteration files will not be recognized by new code
  - Old schema: `extraction.json`, `extraction-corrected1.json`, `validation.json`, `validation-corrected1.json`
  - New schema: `extraction0.json`, `extraction1.json`, `validation0.json`, `validation1.json`
  - All iterations now have explicit numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) for better clarity and consistency
  - Updated file_manager.py: Changed `status` parameter to `iteration_number` in get_filename(), save_json(), and load_json()
  - Updated orchestrator.py: All save_json() calls now use iteration_number parameter (8 locations)
  - Updated result_checker.py: Glob patterns changed to match numbered files (`validation[0-9]*.json`)
  - Updated tests: All filename assertions updated to new schema (3 test files)
  - Updated documentation: settings.py docstring reflects new naming convention
  - Migration note: Users should clear tmp/ directory or delete old iteration files before using new version
  - Legacy 4-step pipeline now saves as extraction1.json/validation1.json (was extraction-corrected.json)
  - Implementation: 6 core files + 3 test files modified
  - All 111 unit tests pass with new naming scheme

- **Streamlit UI** - Updated deprecated `use_container_width` parameter to new `width` parameter
  - Replaced `use_container_width=True` with `width="stretch"` (13 occurrences)
  - Replaced `use_container_width=False` with `width="content"` (1 occurrence)
  - Updated 4 screen files: intro.py, settings.py, upload.py, execution.py
  - Affects st.button() and st.dataframe() components
  - Follows Streamlit deprecation notice (parameter will be removed after 2025-12-31)
  - No functional changes - maintains existing UI behavior

- **Documentation** - Updated architecture and design documentation
  - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md: Pipeline Orchestrator section reflects 3-step model with 10 key functions listed
  - Added new subsection "Iterative Validation-Correction Loop" with workflow, quality assessment formula, status codes, file naming, error handling
  - Design decisions updated: Why 3 steps, why iterative correction, why keep 4-step option, why quality thresholds, why early stopping, why best iteration selection
  - All documentation reflects new combined validation_correction step while maintaining backward compatibility notes

- **Pipeline Execution Metadata** - Comprehensive metadata embedded in step JSON files
  - Added `_pipeline_metadata` field to all step outputs (classification, extraction, validation, correction)
  - Metadata includes: timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC), duration_seconds, LLM provider/model, max_pages, PDF filename, execution_mode (streamlit/cli), status (success/failed)
  - Error handling: Failed steps save `{step}-failed.json` with metadata including error_message and error_type
  - Automatic metadata stripping before schema validation and LLM prompts via `_strip_metadata_for_pipeline()`
  - Enables cost analytics, debugging, and audit trail without external database
  - Added 7 unit tests for metadata stripping helper function (118 total unit tests)
  - Non-breaking: metadata is optional and doesn't affect existing code or schemas
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` covering all 4 pipeline steps

- **Enhanced Verbose Logging Metadata** - Comprehensive API response metadata for debugging and cost optimization
  - Response IDs for debugging and support tickets (both OpenAI and Claude)
  - Model tracking: exact model version used (e.g., "gpt-5-2025-04-14", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
  - Cached tokens display with cache hit percentage for cost optimization (OpenAI only)

  - Fixes KeyError: 'validation_correction' crash in `src/streamlit_app/screens/settings.py:155`
  - Implementation in `src/streamlit_app/result_checker.py`
  - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy validation/correction keys

- **Pipeline Orchestrator** - Fixed "Unsupported provider" error when running validation_correction step
  - Fixed `run_single_step()` passing OpenAIProvider object instead of string to `run_validation_with_correction()`
  - Removed unnecessary `llm = get_llm_provider(llm_provider)` call (line 1597)
  - Changed `llm_provider=llm` to `llm_provider=llm_provider` (line 1603) to pass string parameter
  - `run_validation_with_correction()` expects `llm_provider: str` and creates provider object internally
  - Fixes "Unsupported provider: <src.llm.openai_provider.OpenAIProvider object at 0x...>" error
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` lines 1593-1608
  - Aligns with validation/correction step patterns that also accept string parameters

- **Metadata Stripping** - Fixed validation failure due to unexpected `correction_notes` field
  - Added `correction_notes` to `_strip_metadata_for_pipeline()` stripping logic
  - The correction step adds `correction_notes` for debugging (not part of extraction schema)
  - Now stripped before validation along with `usage`, `_metadata`, `_pipeline_metadata`
  - Fixes schema validation error: "Additional properties are not allowed ('correction_notes' was unexpected)"
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` (line 186 in `_strip_metadata_for_pipeline()`)
  - Added unit test `test_strip_metadata_removes_correction_notes` in `tests/unit/test_orchestrator.py`
  - Updated 3 existing tests to verify correction_notes stripping behavior

- **File Naming Inconsistency** - Fixed validation files missing correct iteration suffix in validation-correction loop
  - Removed duplicate file saves from `_run_correction_step()` (lines 751, 785)
  - Loop now saves both extraction and validation files with iteration suffix `corrected{N}`
  - Fixed issue where `validation-corrected.json` was overwritten each iteration instead of creating numbered versions
  - Fixed missing `validation-corrected1.json` file (was only creating `validation-corrected.json`)
  - Post-correction validation now properly saved with iteration number for each loop iteration
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py`:
    - Removed file saves from `_run_correction_step()` (function only returns data now)
    - Added file saves in `run_validation_with_correction()` loop (lines 1076-1086, 1133-1142)
    - Added file saves in old 4-step STEP_CORRECTION flow (lines 1604-1609)
  - All 111 tests pass, backward compatible with 4-step pipeline

- **Metadata Leakage in Final Results** - Fixed correction_notes leaking into final results returned from validation-correction loop
  - Added `_strip_metadata_for_pipeline()` calls at 3 critical points to prevent correction_notes from appearing in final results:
    1. After correction in main loop before storing in `current_extraction` (line 1090)
    2. After correction in retry error handling path (line 1151)
    3. In legacy 4-step pipeline return before returning corrected extraction (lines 1779-1781)
  - Ensures `iterations[]` array only contains clean extraction data without correction_notes metadata
  - Ensures `best_extraction` selected from iterations is clean (no correction_notes field)
  - Ensures legacy 4-step pipeline returns clean corrected extraction
  - Prevents correction_notes from appearing in validation prompts, LLM inputs, or final results
  - Added comprehensive integration test suite: `tests/integration/test_validation_correction_metadata_stripping.py`
    - Tests correction_notes stripped from final result (best_extraction)
    - Tests correction_notes stripped from all stored iterations
    - Tests all metadata fields stripped (usage, _metadata, _pipeline_metadata, correction_notes)
  - Implementation in `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` (3 stripping locations)
  - All 111 unit tests + 3 new integration tests pass

- Fixed schema bundler creating self-referencing definitions causing validation recursion errors
  - `schemas/json-bundler.py` - Replace local alias definitions with actual definitions from common schema
  - Prevents `ContrastEffect` and similar aliases from becoming `{"$ref": "#/$defs/ContrastEffect"}` self-references
  - Resolves "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error during validation step
  - Affects `observational_analytic_bundled.json` and `interventional_trial_bundled.json`

- **Execution Screen Real-time Feedback** - Fixed step status visibility and updates during pipeline execution
  - Fixed step containers not showing during execution (only "⏳ Pipeline is executing..." was visible)
  - Fixed non-selected steps showing "pending" instead of "⏭️ Skipped"
  - Fixed first step showing "pending" instead of "🔄 Running" when pipeline starts
  - Fixed all steps now show "🔄 Running" status immediately before execution begins (added `st.rerun()` after status update)
  - Removed static "0.0s" elapsed time from running status (shown only for completed/failed)
  - Implemented proactive status updates to work within Streamlit's execution model constraints
  - Added `_mark_next_step_running()` helper to auto-update next step after completion
  - Improved user experience with immediate, accurate step status feedback

- **Partial Pipeline Runs** - Fixed "dependency not found" error when running individual steps
  - Added `PipelineFileManager.load_json()` to load cached results from `tmp/` folder
  - Enables running validation after classification+extraction (separate runs)
  - Enables re-running correction without re-doing extraction
  - Smart fallback: checks previous_results first, then loads from disk, then errors
  - Console feedback (yellow 📂) when loading from disk
  - Better error messages indicating missing dependency files
  - Added 4 new unit tests (111 total tests passing)

### Changed
- **Pipeline Execution Architecture** - Switched to step-by-step execution with real-time UI updates
  - Execute one step at a time with `st.rerun()` between steps instead of running all steps at once

    - `make test-fast` - Run fast unit tests excluding slow tests
  - Enables selective test execution and better test organization
  - Improves development workflow with faster feedback loops

### Deprecated
- Nothing yet

### Removed
- **test.py** - Removed temporary exploratory test file from project root
- **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Removed redundant setup announcement file
  - Content already covered in DEVELOPMENT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md
  - Was a one-time setup summary, not ongoing documentation
  - No references from other documentation files

### Fixed
- **schemas/json-bundler.py** - Fixed critical bug in schema bundling that caused unresolved $refs
  - Problem: Bundler only copied first-level definitions from common.schema.json, but didn't recursively resolve nested $refs within those definitions
  - Example: When bundling `Metadata` definition, it didn't also copy `Author`, `Registration`, `SupplementFile`, etc. that Metadata references
  - Impact: All 5 bundled schemas had 5-7 unresolved $refs each, causing validation failures
  - Solution: Implemented recursive definition collection using a worklist algorithm
    - Added `include_local` parameter to `find_common_refs()` to detect local #/$defs/Name references
    - Modified `bundle_schema()` to recursively process nested dependencies until all are resolved
    - Each embedded definition is now scanned for additional references, which are added to the processing queue
  - Result: All 5 schemas now pass validation with 0 unresolved $refs
  - Files affected: All *_bundled.json schemas now correctly include all transitive dependencies
  - **Tests added**: Comprehensive test coverage following @CONTRIBUTING.md requirements
    - 12 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_json_bundler.py`
    - 5 integration tests in `tests/integration/test_schema_bundling.py`
    - Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/schemas/` with nested reference examples
    - Regression test ensures nested refs (Metadata→Author, Registration→Registry) are all resolved
    - All 17 tests pass ✅
