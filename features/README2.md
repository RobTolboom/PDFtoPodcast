# Feature Briefs

This folder stores lightweight planning documents that describe upcoming or in-flight feature work. Each Markdown file captures the context, goals, and acceptance criteria that guide implementation discussions.

## Current Briefs
- **`code-documentation-improvement.md`** – Expands internal documentation and developer ergonomics across the codebase.
- **`iterative-validation-correction.md`** – Details the multi-pass validation/correction loop and quality thresholds enforced by the pipeline.
- **`orchestrator-step-by-step-refactoring.md`** – Tracks the move toward granular pipeline execution with callback support.
- **`pipeline-execution-implementation.md`** – Outlines requirements for CLI + UI execution paths and telemetry.

## How to Use These Briefs
- Treat them as living documents; update status sections and open questions as work progresses.
- Reference relevant schema, prompt, or code modules directly in the brief to anchor technical decisions.
- Link completed work back to the brief from PR descriptions so stakeholders can follow progress.
- Archive superseded briefs by moving them to a dated subfolder and noting the replacement document.
