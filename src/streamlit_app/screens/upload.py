PDF upload screen for Streamlit interface.

Provides two methods for selecting PDFs:
1. Upload new files with duplicate detection
2. Select from previously uploaded files

Features:
- File size validation (10 MB limit for API compatibility)
- SHA256 hash-based duplicate detection
- Manifest-based file tracking
- File metadata display

def show_upload_screen():
    """
    Display PDF upload screen with file validation, duplicate detection, and file selection.

    Renders a comprehensive upload UI with two tabs for PDF selection. Handles file
    uploads with size validation, SHA256-based duplicate detection, and manifest-based
    file tracking. Allows selection from previously uploaded files with metadata display.

    Tab Structure:
        **Upload New File:**
        - st.file_uploader widget for PDF selection
        - File size validation (10 MB API limit)
        - SHA256 hash calculation for duplicate detection
        - Duplicate warning with automatic tab highlight
        - File save with timestamp-prefixed filename
        - Manifest entry creation with metadata
        - Success message with file information display

        **Select Previously Uploaded:**
        - List of files from manifest (sorted by upload time, newest first)
        - Each file shows: Name, Upload time, Size, Path
        - Highlighted duplicate (if detected in Upload tab)
        - Select button for each file
        - Auto-filters non-existent files from manifest

    File Validation:
        - Maximum size: 10 MB (enforced by LLM API limits)
        - File type: PDF only (enforced by st.file_uploader)
        - Displays error message if file exceeds size limit
        - Shows helpful tips when no file uploaded

    Duplicate Detection Flow:
        1. Calculate SHA256 hash of uploaded file bytes
        2. Check manifest for matching hash
        3. If duplicate found:
           - Show warning with duplicate filename and date
           - Set highlighted_file in session state
           - Display info message to switch tabs
           - Do NOT save file again
        4. If no duplicate:
           - Generate unique filename with timestamp
           - Save file to UPLOAD_DIR
           - Add to manifest with metadata
           - Set pdf_path and uploaded_file_info in session state

    State Management:
        Reads from session state:
        - uploader_key: Counter for forcing file_uploader widget reset
        - highlighted_file: Path to file that should be highlighted (for duplicates)

        Writes to session state:
        - pdf_path: Full path to selected PDF file
        - uploaded_file_info: Dictionary with file metadata:
          - hash: SHA256 hash
          - path: Full file path
          - original_name: Original filename from upload
          - size_mb: File size in megabytes
          - upload_time: ISO format timestamp
        - highlighted_file: Path to highlight (for duplicate detection UX)
        - uploader_key: Incremented when "Select Different File" clicked
        - current_phase: Set to "intro" or "settings" on navigation

    Navigation:
        Bottom buttons (shown only when file is selected):
        - "Back to Intro": Returns to intro screen
        - "Select Different File": Resets selection and increments uploader_key
        - "Continue to Settings": Proceeds to settings configuration

        When no file selected:
        - Only "Back to Intro" button shown

    Manifest Management:
        Uses file_management functions for:
        - load_manifest(): Load existing file list
        - save_manifest(): Persist manifest updates
        - calculate_file_hash(): SHA256 hashing
        - find_duplicate_by_hash(): Check for existing files
        - add_file_to_manifest(): Add new file entry
        - get_uploaded_files(): Get list with auto-cleanup

    Example Workflow:
        1. User uploads PDF via file_uploader widget
        2. System validates size (< 10 MB)
        3. System calculates SHA256 hash
        4. System checks for duplicate:
           - If duplicate: Show warning, highlight in "Select Previously Uploaded" tab
           - If new: Save file, add to manifest, show success message
        5. User clicks "Continue to Settings" to proceed

    Note:
        - Files saved with format: {YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}_{original_name}.pdf
        - Upload directory created automatically if doesn't exist
        - Manifest file (.manifest.json) stores all file metadata
        - Duplicate detection prevents redundant storage
        - File_uploader widget reset via key parameter change (uploader_key)
        - All file paths use Path objects for cross-platform compatibility
        - Error handling for file I/O operations with user-friendly messages
