# Plans Directory

The `docs/plans/` folder stores feature and implementation planning documents. Each Markdown file outlines scope, tasks, risks, and acceptance criteria for a proposed enhancement or fix. When starting new work, create a fresh file (for example, `feature-name.md`) summarising:

- Goal and business value
- User stories or acceptance criteria
- Implementation plan and dependencies
- Testing and validation strategy
- Open questions or risks

Update the document as the work progresses, and link it from relevant pull requests or issue trackers.
